Pacpan helps you package and run panels apps with as little configuration as needed.

Development is the default mode of operation. It is what happens when you run "pacpan".

You can target multiple apps at once, just run: "pacpan . ../path/to/another/app".
Notice the first ".", it means that you want to target this directory as an app too.

"pacpan bundle" bundles the assets for you.`
